1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Darling, don't move too much

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
'Cause you might break the things that you have touched

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But let me tell you, don't go too far

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And just enjoy this artistic room of ours

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This empty canvas that they misunderstood

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I wanna paint you in it but I'm not good

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
'Cause I wanna look at you when we are apart

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
'Cause you're not just a human being, you are art

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So darling, darling, don't be scared

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
'Cause even if I look everywhere

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Your colors caught my eye

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And you're my favorite sight to see

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's from the way that you move

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And everything that you do

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And after that it's when I realize

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That I love you

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You told me to look everywhere else

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But I said no, 'cause when I look at you

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My heart always melts

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I stayed even though you're a mess

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
'Cause you're like drugs and with you

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, I'm obsessed

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So darling, darling, don't be scared

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
'Cause even if I look everywhere

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your colors caught my eye

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And you're my favorite sight to see

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's from the way that you move

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And everything that you do

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And after that it's when I realize

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That I love you

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Darling, darling, don't be scared

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
'Cause even if I look everywhere

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your colors caught my eye

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And you're my favorite sight to see
